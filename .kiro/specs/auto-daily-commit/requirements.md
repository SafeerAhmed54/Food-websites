# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a Next.js project that automatically commits itself daily as long as there are changes to commit. The system will monitor the project for changes and create meaningful daily commits with appropriate commit messages, ensuring continuous version control without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my Next.js project to automatically commit changes daily, so that I maintain a consistent commit history without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs daily THEN it SHALL check for uncommitted changes in the project
2. WHEN uncommitted changes exist THEN the system SHALL create a commit with a meaningful message
3. WHEN no changes exist THEN the system SHALL skip the commit process
4. WHEN the commit process fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the auto-commit system to generate meaningful commit messages, so that my commit history remains informative and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a commit THEN the system SHALL generate a descriptive commit message based on file changes
2. WHEN multiple file types are changed THEN the system SHALL summarize the changes appropriately
3. WHEN only specific file types are changed THEN the system SHALL use category-specific commit messages
4. WHEN the commit message exceeds reasonable length THEN the system SHALL truncate it appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the auto-commit system to run automatically without my intervention, so that I don't need to remember to trigger it manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Next.js application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the auto-commit scheduler
2. WHEN the scheduled time arrives THEN the system SHALL execute the commit process
3. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL maintain the daily schedule
4. IF the system is offline during scheduled time THEN it SHALL execute the commit on next startup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the auto-commit behavior, so that I can customize it to my workflow preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to set the commit time
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable the feature
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to set custom commit message patterns
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply them without restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle Git operations safely, so that it doesn't interfere with my manual Git workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking for changes THEN the system SHALL only commit tracked and modified files
2. WHEN a merge conflict exists THEN the system SHALL skip auto-commit and log a warning
3. WHEN the repository is in a detached HEAD state THEN the system SHALL skip auto-commit
4. WHEN manual Git operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL wait or skip the commit

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see logs of auto-commit activities, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an auto-commit is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with timestamp
2. WHEN an auto-commit succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the commit hash and message
3. WHEN an auto-commit fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details
4. WHEN viewing logs THEN I SHALL see the last 30 days of auto-commit activity
